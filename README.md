Coursework Description

Introduction

A tour company in London would like you to design part of an application designed ot make it
easier for people to find out what they can see and do around London. The aim of the part of
the system you are to design is to have a list of attractions, and, for each attraction, find out
the price of admittance (if any), the opening time and the closing time (in 24 hour clock time,
e.g, 1900 or 2300).

The kind of attractions available to start with are parks, museums and theatres. Parks have
free admittance, some musuems (but not all) have free admittance, and theatres charge.
Opening times and closing times depend upon the particular attraction.

Question 1 (30 marks)
The tour company want the application to be able to deal with attractions in a uniform manner.
That is, they want to write code that can ask an object representing an attraction for its price,
no matter what kind of attraction it is. Discuss how you might use generalization to allow
different attractions to be dealt with in a uniform manner. Your discussion should describe the
main concepts to be models (you can include description of key attributes and operations that
can be identified), and their relationships. You should include in your explanation which
relationships are generalizations and why.

Question 2 (30 marks)
Present a class diagram that uses generalization to allow attractions to be dealt with uniformly.
Include any methods that are appropriate.

Question 3 (40 marks)
Implement your class diagram in C++, and include a main function that demonstrates your
code. The main function should create a vector or list of attractions and find, by iterating over
the list, which attractions are open after 1900 and which cost less than Â£5.
Discuss any problems or issues that arose from implementing your class diagram., and explain
how you solved them.
